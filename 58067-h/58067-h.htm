LETTER, &amp;c.</h2>
<p><i>My dear Friends</i>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Knowing</span> that it is your desire to
hear something respecting the close of the life of my invaluable
friend, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>, now in glory,
and being assured that none but myself can undertake the work, as
I alone was her constant companion, being separated scarcely a
day for more than 15 years, I have endeavoured, (while my mind
has been exercised with the most painful feelings of heartfelt
sorrow for the loss of the best of friends, the wisest of
counsellors, and the tenderest of parents,) to set down a few
circumstances relative to the close of a life surpassing in
usefulness most of her fellow mortals.</p>
<p>It was upon the 9th of December, 1815, a day never to be
forgotten by <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>me, that my Elijah was taken to heaven.&nbsp; O that the
mantle might rest on me!&nbsp; She had had many severe attacks
from illness in various ways, in former years, and sometimes was
restored as by miracle; I therefore continued hoping she would be
spared this time also; nor did I give up that hope till two days
before her removal from earth to heaven.</p>
<p>Though she would be often saying to me, &ldquo;My dear child,
do not flatter yourself that I shall be long with you, for I feel
I am going;&rdquo;&mdash;yet, still willing to hope for what I so
much desired, I continued thinking, it may be the Lord will look
graciously upon me, and save me from drinking this bitter cup for
a while longer: but on December 7th, I found it necessary to
render her more assistance than usual while rising in the
morning, and conscious that this was a mark of increased
weakness, I became greatly affected; and, having done all she at
that time needed, I retired <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>to plead with the Lord that she might
yet be restored; but, alas!&nbsp; I had no power, and was
constrained to leave it to divine wisdom to do what he saw best;
and before I rose from my knees, it was strongly impressed on my
mind,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The everlasting doors shall soon the saint
receive,<br />
Among yon angel pow&rsquo;rs in glorious bliss to live;<br />
Far from a world of grief and sin,<br />
With God eternally shut in.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From that moment I gave up every hope of her longer abiding in
the flesh; though once or twice afterwards, my strong desire led
me to plead, that he who had raised the ruler&rsquo;s daughter,
the widow&rsquo;s son, and dead Lazarus, would yet restore her:
but all the answer I could obtain was, Divine wisdom cannot
err.</p>
<p>For the last month of her life, her breath was more oppressed
than usual: it had been much affected for years, upon motion; yet
when she sat still, or laid herself down at night, she could
breathe quite easy; but the middle of November <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>last her
breathing was affected both while she sat still and when she was
laid down.&nbsp; She had also a troublesome cough, that disturbed
her rest at night; and when this was the case, her strength
quickly declined.&nbsp; She had had a wound for two years and 3
quarters in one side of her left breast, which was at first
supposed to be a cancer; but her sufferings from this were not to
be compared with what she suffered from her breath.</p>
<p>Yet, with all that she went through, how did she labour for
the good of souls!&nbsp; Many times she has gone to speak to the
people, when she has said, &ldquo;It is like as if every meeting
would take away my life, but I&rsquo;ll speak to them as long as
I can; while I&rsquo;ve any breath, and power to get out,
I&rsquo;ll not spare myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; And truly she did not,
as will be readily testified by many hundreds who have been in
the habit of attending her meetings.</p>
<p>I am inclined to think, that the 24th <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>of last July
will not be forgotten by a large proportion of the great numbers
who crowded to hear her: she explained the 25th chapter of
Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel.&nbsp; It was the last monday night she
was able to speak to a listening crowd of attentive hearers, some
of whom had come many miles, but did not think much of the pains
they took, because of the spiritual good they derived from the
opportunity.&nbsp; I remember she spoke in a peculiarly striking
manner on the necessity of being born again.&nbsp; When she came
to the 13th verse, &ldquo;Watch therefore, for ye know neither
the day nor the hour wherein the Son of Man cometh,&rdquo; and
from the following verses respecting the Talents, she enlarged
much; powerfully insisting upon the right use of the
understanding, will, mind, or memory, with every affection; the
right application of time, with every penny of money; and the
watching over the tongue, which she observed might enjoy the
honor of being God&rsquo;s advocate, but for want of watchfulness
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>was, as the
Apostle expresses it, &ldquo;set on fire of hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it is in vain for me to attempt to repeat any part of what
at that time was felt in many hearts.&nbsp; She continued to meet
her classes occasionally, as she had strength for it, until the
middle of October.&nbsp; Her two o&rsquo;clock sabbath-day
meeting she spoke at on the last sabbath of September: this was
her last public engagement.&nbsp; Many striking proofs we have
had that her labours of love in this way were not in vain; for it
is certain many souls were brought to God through her.&nbsp; In
one of her noon meetings she read some account of the opening of
her room for the preaching of the gospel; and as I believe it
will not be unacceptable to you, I will insert it as it was put
down by one present at the time of its first being used for the
good of souls, and the glory of God.</p>
<blockquote><p>The first sabbath in July, 1788, the room at the
Vicarage in Madeley <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>was opened; it had been for many years a barn, but was
now fitted up for divine worship.</p>
<p>The Rev. Melville Horne preached from I Kings, chap. ix, ver.
3.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the Lord said unto him, I have heard thy
prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me; I have
hallowed this house which thou hast built, to put my name there,
and mine eyes and my heart shall be there
perpetually.&rdquo;&nbsp; He observed how great was our privilege
in being so favored with places and opportunities of quietly
waiting upon the Lord, and the advantage of sitting under a pure
gospel; and how much would be required of them to whom so much
was given.</p>
<p>He then sweetly invited us to turn our eye towards the living
Temple, in whom we should be always sure to meet the
Father&rsquo;s love: and, in conclusion, read the part following
the text, to the 10th verse; pointing out the covenant <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>blessing on
obedience, and the certain destruction which would follow the
reverse.</p>
<p>As soon as he had ended his sermon, before he had time to
pray, he was suddenly called out to a funeral which was waiting,
and left Mrs. Fletcher to dismiss the people.&nbsp; She observed
the solemnity of the occasion, and the great expectation she felt
in her heart that the Lord would pour out his Spirit on the souls
before him; and entreated them to look up, and open their hearts
to receive it.&nbsp; As an encouragement, she reminded them of
the many prayers which for twenty-five years had been night and
day offered up in their behalf; the purport of which was, that
they might behold a reconciled Father in the face of Christ
Jesus: that in the dedication of Solomon&rsquo;s Temple, the
people were called to eat and to drink, and to send portions to
those who had none.&nbsp; She also observed, all the glory of
Israel, being outward, was but a type <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>of the inward glory of the christian
church.&nbsp; Therefore, (said she,) this day God calls you to
eat and to drink, yea, to take of the water of life, and that
freely.&nbsp; But are some dry and barren?&nbsp; He sends
portions to them that have none.&nbsp; She then added, I will
speak freely: since I have been preparing this place, these words
of our Lord have repeatedly come into my mind, &ldquo;With desire
have I desired to eat this passover with you before I
suffer.&rdquo;&nbsp; This has caused me sometimes to think, does
my Lord intend shortly to remove me to himself?&nbsp; Be that as
it may, I have a confidence that this place will be continued to
your use for some years to come, and that the Lord will bless you
therein.&nbsp; And now I have two petitions to ask you, which I
think you will not deny me.&nbsp; My dear friends, my first
petition is, that you would consider this day as a fresh
covenanting with the Lord to be his without reserve, and that we
may with one consent unite in a solemn vow never to draw
back.&nbsp; My second <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>request is, that when I am laid
silent in the grave, (which, be it sooner or later, most of you
will probably see,) I ask you, at <i>that time</i> to remember
the transaction of this day, and whensoever you pass by this
place, grant me a moment&rsquo;s thought;&mdash;the carnal say,
the tribute of a tear: not so with me; no, my beloved friends, I
rejoice not in your tears, but in your happiness:&mdash;grant me
then a moment&rsquo;s thought, I will tell you what it shall
be.&nbsp; On the first sabbath, in July, 1788, beneath that roof
I covenanted to be the Lord&rsquo;s; then pause a moment, and
say, &ldquo;Thy vows are upon me, O God; I have opened my mouth
unto the Lord, and I cannot draw back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She then concluded this uncommonly solemn meeting with prayer,
after singing the following hymn:</p>
<p>Spirit of holiness descend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And consecrate this place;<br />
With thine Almighty power defend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And crown it with thy grace.</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Let it
be stored with heavenly wheat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The harvest of the Lord,<br />
With sinners brought to Jesu&rsquo;s feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Obedient to his word.</p>
<p>No more design&rsquo;d for earthly good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or product of the ground,<br />
May it be fill&rsquo;d with sacred food,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy high praise resound.</p>
<p>Ye neighbours who surround this place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The message is for you;<br />
Despise not then his offer&rsquo;d grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor slight the heavenly dew.</p>
<p>How many pray&rsquo;rs in heaven are filed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Madeley favor&rsquo;d flock;<br />
Behold a Father reconciled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Jesus Christ your Rock.</p>
<p>Then let the joys of heaven abound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er Sinners brought to God;<br />
And many at his feet be found,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All wash&rsquo;d in Jesu&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>That voice which once you loved to hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Invites you from above,<br />
And bids you cast off every fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And trust in Jesu&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Then let us vow to serve the Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And choose his holy ways;<br />
To walk according to his word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Devoted to his praise.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>And
when the lips that call you now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are silent in the dust,<br />
Remember <i>then</i> our solemn vow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shew in whom you trust.</p>
<p>For soon the Archangel&rsquo;s trump shall sound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And summon us on high;<br />
The Shepherd with his Flock be found,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all our tears be dry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some circumstances occurring last summer, which brought to her
recollection afresh the solemn season of the opening of her room,
27 years before, she took the paper I have now been copying, and
read it to the people; and there is good reason to believe, that
our heavenly Father was pleased to make this also, such a season
of refreshing to some then present, that they will ever remember
it with gratitude: indeed, all her labours of love were, in a
peculiar manner, blest of God.&nbsp; Six years after the opening
of her room, the old church was taken down, and the church
service was performed in it till the new one was erected.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Amongst
the numerous company that will have to ascribe glory to our God
for good received through her instrumentality, under that roof, I
cannot forbear saying, my hope is, that I shall stand among the
ransomed of the Lord, and say, &ldquo;I was born
there.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, my friends, I must say, the good Lord
made her the means of the awakening, conversion, and deepening
the work of grace in my soul: and while I give all the glory to
my God for the grace received, I cannot but feel much love to the
channel through which that grace was communicated.&nbsp; Nor are
my feelings in this peculiar, they are the feelings of a number
of lively souls, who bless God that the sound of her voice ever
reached their ears; and in whose affections she will long live,
and though dead yet speak.</p>
<p>On the 4th of September, 1808, she was to have had a meeting
at six o&rsquo;clock in the evening, but was prevented through
sickness; she therefore wrote, the following note, for me to read
to the people:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span><i>My dearly beloved in the Lord</i>,</p>
<p>My delight is to worship the Lord with you, and many, very
many, sweet times have we had together; but our unerring master
has, at this time, been pleased to confine me by a greater degree
of weakness than I ever remember before; therefore, by my pen,
through the mouth of my dear friend, I take this method to assure
you, I am with you in spirit, though absent in body; and I
intreat you all to make trial of the ground whereon you stand:
when sickness and death approaches, there is no comfort but in
the love of God; I find none but what I derive from that
source.&nbsp; O that you would therefore do as Jacob did, be
earnest with the Lord, that his love may fill your heart, as the
scripture expresses it, the love of God shed abroad in your
hearts by the Holy Ghost, given unto you.&nbsp; If you get your
hearts full of the love of God, you will find that is the oil by
which the lamp of faith will be ever kept burning; love makes all
our duty easy; a soul united as one <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>spirit to the Lord, if temptation
presents, has a ready answer; such a one instantly cries out, How
shall I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? against
Him in whom my soul delighteth?&nbsp; Pray, my friends, pray much
for this love; and remember that word, &ldquo;He that dwelleth in
love dwelleth in God, and God in him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus did she, whether sick or well, labour for the increase of
spirituality in the hearts of the people: her eyes were always
heaven-ward, and whether at home or abroad, she was ever
endeavouring to draw souls to a closer walk with God.&nbsp; She
was often reminding us who were about her, of the fulness that
was to be obtained.&nbsp; I shall not exceed the; truth, if I say
that none more fully possessed the happy art of leading souls
into a close internal walk with God, than she did; being herself
so experimentally acquainted with the path of righteousness, she
was well qualified to conduct others therein: and as to her own
soul, <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>she
was continually drinking more and more into the spirit of her
Lord.&nbsp; Her capacious soul was always panting after deeper
and deeper draughts of the living water; frequently telling me
what sweet openings the Lord had been giving her, and what
enjoyment in the filling and enlarging of her desires.&nbsp; She
was ever desirous that souls would be looking for great things
from the hands of the Lord; frequently saying, &ldquo;what pity
it is that any rest in low attainments, when so much might be
gained; has not the Lord said, Ask what you will, and I will do
it for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; This last sentence was one of those
sayings of our Divine Master, in which she delighted to the end
of her course.&nbsp; I believe there are numbers who cannot
forget with what energy she would recommend the wrestling Jacob;
and whatever duty she enforced upon the minds of others, she was
exemplary in practising herself.&nbsp; It was always her custom,
unless some providential call prevented, to go from secret prayer
to the class, and from the <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>class to prayer: thus did she
habitually draw fresh supplies of light and life from above; and
when the seed was sown, her unwearied supplications followed
it.&nbsp; Indeed she was a great lover of prayer, and often
continued in that exercise on her knees for such a length of
time, (white her strength would admit of it,) that I have
sometimes gone into her chamber to remind her how long she had
been, fearing she would injure her body; but on such occasions
she has sweetly smiled, and said, &ldquo;I shall be none the
worse for prayer; come, kneel down by me, let us pray
together.&rdquo;&nbsp; At another of these times, she has said,
&ldquo;No, not leave off praying yet; my dear husband used to
say, <i>let me wrestle till I die</i>.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t leave
off yet, but come and join me; great things are promised where
two agree to ask in the name of Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many of these
times have become seasons of peculiar advantage: <i>my</i> soul
has cause to praise the Lord both for her private, social, and
public exercises.&nbsp; A paper containing <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>some short
hints for prayer, which I found in a testament that lay by her
the last week of her life, I will here insert.&nbsp; She begins,
first in the morning, by asking permission to throw herself again
at the feet of her most gracious loving Saviour, and to praise
him for preserving her from every evil through the night, and for
having brought her to another day.&nbsp; She notes as subjects of
praise, a degree of ease, eye-sight, hearing, the use of her
limbs and understanding; and then names, as heads for
supplication, the power to walk with God, to take up every cross,
and to watch the tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Second time of private
prayer</i>.</p>
<p>Intercession for our relations in England, Switzerland,
Aleppo, &amp;c. for the spirit of prayer, light into my state of
soul, increase of faith, for power never to offend with my
tongue, with praise and acts of resignation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Third time</i>.</p>
<p>For a <i>ready</i> mind to do all the commands of my God, for
deep humility, to <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>be brought into the entire region of love, by the
baptism of the Holy Spirit, that nothing may remain in my soul
but pure love alone; for faithfulness in the use of every talent;
light and liberty in the meetings, and a special blessing on
every member thereof; for the children, the ministry, and the
whole parish.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Fourth time</i>.</p>
<p>Praise for the mercies of the day, intreaties for a spiritual
night; that the Lord would fulfil that promise, &ldquo;I will
bless them that bless thee,&rdquo; first, by returning all the
kindness they have shewn to me; secondly, by repaying any
injuries I may have rendered to any by thought, word, or deed, if
on earth by such blessings as are most for their good, if in
heaven by adding to their crown so much more for what they had
suffered from me.</p>
<p>After mentioning these four times of private prayer, she then
notices praying with me before going to bed; at which time she
says, &ldquo;remember all the sufferers who have recommended
themselves <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>to my prayer.&rdquo;&nbsp; The paper concludes with
family prayer, of which she says, &ldquo;at each time of family
prayer, to read with profit, and to pray with fervor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can witness with how much diligence she discharged this duty
of family prayer, always being remarkably careful that every one
who worked in her house should be present upon this occasion; for
she looked upon it as an opportunity of giving them a message to
their souls: and times more than I can number she has had such up
stairs, that she might pray with them, when her breath has been
so oppressed that she has said, (while they were coming,)
&ldquo;I do not know whether I can speak a word, but if I can I
will.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last time the washerwoman and the gardener
were in her study, her prayer will not soon be forgot by the
persons present; she was at that time in a state of great bodily
suffering, (it was only a few weeks before her translation to
glory,) and was not able both to read and pray; I therefore <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>read a short
account of a pious man out of the Methodist Magazine, and she
prayed, mentioning each distinctly in such a clear, striking, and
forcible manner, as if fully persuaded she should never pray with
them again.&nbsp; All was deeply solemn, and I could not help
observing, when we rose from our knees, I did not remember ever
feeling such at time before: she answered, &ldquo;I want them to
turn to God; I long for the salvation of all around
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gardener&rsquo;s wife has since told me, that when her
husband returned home at night, he told her, &ldquo;he never
heard any thing like that morning&rsquo;s prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was not an uncommon thing for her prayers to be
unusually blessed to souls: many have come from far to see her,
that she might plead with God in their behalf; some of these,
when they have come to her, have been laden with guilt, a heavy
load, but our good <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>Lord has heard the voice of her supplications, and so
manifested himself as a sin-pardoning God, that the mourners have
been comforted, their sorrows have been turned into joy, and they
have left her habitation to go on their way rejoicing.&nbsp; I
refer not in this to a solitary instance, but mention it as a
circumstance that was often recurring.</p>
<p>Of her I may say, every talent given was duly improved; for
she did not spare herself, but her strength, her time, and
substance, she cheerfully devoted to the benefit of the souls and
bodies of others; and as her prayers were very prevalent, so were
her charities very extensive.&nbsp; Upon this subject, before I
proceed, I feel it my duty to make one remark: I have heard some
persons say, &ldquo;O she was imposed upon.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, as
I knew her better than any person now alive, I must beg leave to
affirm, that she was not the dupe of the designing; her good
sense was equal to her piety, and her charities were conducted
with <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>such
a degree of wisdom, that fraudulent cases, in a general way, were
detected by her: though, whenever a doubtful case occurred, she
would say, &ldquo;it is better to be on the right side, and to
give a trifle to an unworthy object, than run a risk of
overlooking one that ought to be relieved.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon such
occasions no doubt the worthless have sometimes partaken of her
bounty, but never to any considerable amount.&nbsp; She was one
of a thousand for economy; always sparing of expense upon
herself, that she might have the more to give to the household of
faith.&nbsp; She would often say, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s receivers
upon earth, are, Christ&rsquo;s church and poor.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When, I have proposed the purchase of some article of clothing
for her, she would say, &ldquo;is it quite necessary? if it is
not, do not buy it; it will be much better to give the money to
some of our poor neighbours, than to lay it out upon
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor was this once only; it was invariably her
conduct, and with great truth it may be said, that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What her charity impair&rsquo;d<br />
She saved by prudence in affairs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>She was
always remarkably exact in setting down every penny she
expended.&nbsp; She kept four different accounts, in which all
she spent was included; these four were, the house, sundries,
clothes, and poor.&nbsp; We have often at the end of the year
been astonished to find the house expensed so small, considering
how many had shared with us: at such times, she has said,
&ldquo;It is the Lord who has blessed our bread and
water.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have, in former years, taken up the book in
which she kept her accounts, and wept over it, with the
consideration, that I should one day probably have to settle it
alone; and now I have drank of the bitter cup.&nbsp; A few days
ago, I entered upon the work; and I think it right, as a
confirmation of what I have before advanced, to state the
difference between the expenses of her clothes, and what she had
dispensed to the poor.&nbsp; On making up the account of her
clothes, I found the whole year&rsquo;s expenditure amounted to
nineteen shillings and six-pence; this was every penny that had
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>been laid
out; on her own person, for the whole year. <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a></p>
<p>I then made up the poor&rsquo;s account, and found the amount
to be 181l 16s. 1d thus liberally had she dispensed abroad.&nbsp;
But her desire of communicating comfort to the afflicted, was
very extensive: I do not think she ever heard of a person in
distress, but, if in her power to do it, she, by some means
contrived to send relief.&nbsp; To comfort the distressed, was
always a real comfort to her.&nbsp; With regard to this
world&rsquo;s wealth, it was no more to her, than dust in the
balance.&nbsp; She has often said, and I am sure with great
truth, &ldquo;Gold is no more to me than dust; the gold of Ophir
than the stones of the brook.&rdquo;&nbsp; At another time <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>she would
say, &ldquo;It is not so important what we have, as how we use
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed she was truly diligent, so to occupy with
this and every talent, as to be always well-pleasing in the sight
of the Lord.</p>
<p>Her love to every one was so abundant, that she was unwilling
to find a fault in any one; but, ever desirous of casting the
mantle of love over the failings of each, she would seek out the
excellencies of those with whom she was concerned, and would find
an excuse for the conduct of any, if the case would admit of
it.&nbsp; And while her kindness was thus extensively manifested
to all with whom she had any intercourse, her gratitude to others
who shewed marks of love to her, was no less; for when her kind
friends sent her any thing they thought would be acceptable, it
was her study to think how she could return them an equal token
of love; and if nothing was brought to her mind to do for them at
the time, she would say, &ldquo;Well, <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>if I can do no more for them, I can
pray for them:&rdquo;&mdash;then would she fervently cry to the
Lord, that he would repay them for her, and impart to them
spiritual blessings for all the temporal good they had
communicated to her.&nbsp; I never knew her sit down to partake
of any thing that was the gift of a friend, without first praying
for the donor.&nbsp; She would have thought herself very guilty
to have omitted this, but it was a thing she made such a point
of, that I do not think she ever forgot, even in one single
instance.</p>
<p>And while her gratitude to the creature was thus evidently
discerned, her praise and thanksgiving to the Creator was still
more abundant.&nbsp; Never was any one more completely sensible
of surrounding mercies, or more fully satisfied with divine
appointments.&nbsp; She has for a long time lived in the spirit
of praise, frequently saying, &ldquo;What blessings has the Lord
bestowed upon me! how comfortable has he made me in my old age;
<a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>though I
am left here, and my dearly beloved husband, and my Sally, my
child, in glory, yet I know no lack; for how has the Lord
fulfilled that word, given me so many years ago, <i>God will make
you a comfortable habitation</i>. <a name="citation30"></a><a
href="#footnote30" class="citation">[30]</a>&nbsp; And what a
comfortable habitation has he made me! all is so suitable, every
thing that I want; and such a loving people, I may well say I
dwell among my own people: and that the Lord should bring you
from a distance, first to be my spiritual child, and now my
careful housekeeper, my tender nurse, my faithful
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the way that in her common conversation she
enumerated the mercies of the Lord; and as the close of life drew
nigh, the spirit of praise increased more and more.&nbsp; Not
quite three weeks before she was taken from us, she mentioned to
some friends, a <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>dream she had had many years ago.&nbsp; She dreamt she
was going down a rough road, with a short wall by the side of it,
which she leaned upon, and called the wall of salvation: all the
light she had, while getting along with difficulty, was a
twinkling star.&nbsp; She persevered to the end, but then found a
mud-pond, which when she saw, she thought, well, if this is the
way, I&rsquo;ll plunge in; but while she was thinking to do so,
in a moment of time, the twinkling star became a bright comet;
and by the blazing light it gave, she discovered a clean narrow
path by which she was instantly over, she hardly knew how.&nbsp;
After our friends were gone, she said to me, &ldquo;That dreamt
came so powerfully to my mind, I could not help repeating it; it
is being accomplished now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several times after that
evening, she said to me, &ldquo;I am going down the rough walk;
this illness has been a long and painful one, but I lean upon the
wall of salvation, and the comet will come.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
seemed to be assured, from the time this dream was so impressed
<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>upon her
mind, that in an instant of time she should be removed from a
state of suffering to an inconceivable blaze of glory, that would
as much outweigh every spiritual enjoyment upon earth, as the
comet in her sleep outshone the twinkling star.</p>
<p>Before this last three weeks of her life, in which such a
striking application of her dream was made to her, the enemy had
at times suggested what a state of suffering lay before her, if
at the end of her affliction she should be long confined to a
sick bed; or it might be that I may be so wearied by long
fatigue, as not to be able to assist her in that helpless state;
and to have had strangers about her would have been a most
peculiar trial.&nbsp; But out of all this, how soon did the Lord
deliver her: indeed the trial never lasted long, for she knew</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That as her day, her strength had
been,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and believed,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So it would for ever be.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>One
day, when her sufferings were great, she said, &ldquo;How sweet
are the words of the Apostle, The sufferings of this life are not
worthy to be compared with the glory that shall
follow.&rdquo;&nbsp; And on the 11th of November she mentioned
the divine aid she found in these words, &ldquo;Call upon me in
the time of trouble; so will I hear thee, and thou shalt glorify
me:&rdquo; these were words she frequently mentioned, and
sometimes would add, &ldquo;Yes, my Lord, I will call upon thee;
and I shall glorify thee too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another time she said, with peculiar energy, &ldquo;They that
trust in the Lord, shall never be confounded.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
one day, after naming some sentences which she felt a spring of
pleasure in, she added, with much animation in her countenance,
&ldquo;And that given so many years ago now comes with fresh
power, <i>Thou shalt walk with me in white</i>: and when I
answered, how can that be, seeing I am not worthy? it was
repeated, but thou shalt walk with me in white, for <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>will make
thee worthy; I will thoroughly purge away thy dross, and take
away thy tin; everlasting life is won, glory is on earth
begun.&rdquo; <a name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34"
class="citation">[34]</a></p>
<p>One night she spake of finding a powerful application of these
words, &ldquo;I will trust, and will not be afraid, for the Lord
Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become my
salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 18th of November, with much animation she often
repeated, &ldquo;I am thine, and thou art mine, a bond eternal
hath us joined!&rdquo;&nbsp; On the 20th, she said, &ldquo;Just
as I was waking, after my first sleep last night, I felt these
words come so powerfully, Sufficient is his arm alone, and our
defence is sure:&mdash;I instantly answered, <i>our</i>, what my
friend and me? it then seemed spoken again with still greater
weight, Sufficient is his arm alone, and our defence is
sure.&nbsp; <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>This (continued she) was at the beginning of the night,
and a suffering night it has been; but a night in which I have
seen the pleasure of the Lord, and felt his goodness rest upon
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, the goodness of the Lord, and the great things that
faith will do, were subjects on which she delighted to
dwell.&nbsp; I have often heard her say, &ldquo;The particular
commission the Lord had given her, was to encourage souls to
believe:&rdquo; and herein she was greatly blessed to many.</p>
<p>On the 23d, she many times repeated these words, which she
said came to her with unusual sweetness in the night,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Saviour and
King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy succour afford,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy righteousness bring;<br />
Thy righteousness wearing, and cleans&rsquo;d by thy blood,<br />
Bold shall I appear in the presence of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this day she had a great degree of fever upon her, and
would sometimes say to me, &ldquo;What were the sweet words <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>the Lord gave
me last night?&rdquo;&nbsp; As soon as I pronounced the first
words, &ldquo;My Saviour,&rdquo; she would go on with them, and
add, &ldquo;I feel the power of them, though my head was so
confused, with this fever, that I could not recollect
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was always exceedingly affectionate to me; and as it
pleased God through her means, to kindle the first spark of
spiritual life in my soul, I ought also to say, that nothing has
ever been wanting on her part to increase the kindled fire, on
the contrary, she was always a helper of my faith, as well as the
most indulgent friend: numberless are the times she has expressed
her strong attachment <i>to</i>, and great affection <i>for</i>,
me.&nbsp; Never was any thing more expressive, than, on the 6th
of December, while looking on me with a look of the tenderest
affection, she said, &ldquo;My faithful friend, my dearest
friend, ten thousand blessings on her head.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several
other times, especially in the last week <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>of her life,
with eyes and hands lifted up to heaven, she would exclaim,
&ldquo;What shall I do for my friend?&rdquo;&nbsp; She has for
years been in the habit of repeating the following verse;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thy bounteous hand with worldly bliss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has made my cup run o&rsquo;er;<br />
And, in a kind and faithful friend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has doubled all my store.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She would often be crying to God for a blessing upon such and
such particular souls; and all her relations, though so far from
her in body, were to the last interested in her prayers: she
would frequently plead with the Lord, that one day she might meet
them all in glory.&nbsp; Ever after December begun, she was much
inclined to doze, when the cough and the oppression upon her
breath would allow her a degree of ease: this she would complain
of, saying, &ldquo;I lose my time; I want every moment to be
spent in prayer or praise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day, I think the 6th of December, when waking out of a
doze, she <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>said, &ldquo;I am drawing near to glory:&rdquo; and soon
after, &ldquo;There is my house and portion fair;&rdquo; and
again, &ldquo;Jesus come, my hope of glory:&rdquo; and, after a
short pause, &ldquo;He lifts his hands, and shews that I am
graven there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 7th of December, taking my hand in her&rsquo;s, she
said, &ldquo;My precious, my invaluable friend, I have prayed
that light and wisdom may guide you in all, in every difficulty,
and it will be so, I know it will; my prayer for thee is heard,
my choice friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; This afternoon Mrs. Harper called
to see her, but finding her much inclined to doze, she soon left
the room: when Mrs. Fletcher opened her eyes, and found she was
gone, she said, &ldquo;O! she&rsquo;s gone, without a parting
word; I should have taken leave of her.&rdquo;&nbsp; As Mrs. H.
was but just gone, I called her back: she then took her by the
hand, and said, &ldquo;May the Lord be abundantly with you, and
your daughter; and I pray for your son too.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this
day, at every waking interval, <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>she would be saying, &ldquo;What
mercies!&nbsp; Surrounded with mercies! how full of mercies I
am!&rdquo;&nbsp; All her soul seemed lost in love and praise.</p>
<p>The day following, the 8th, was as the day before, a day of
praise for fullness of blessing; after saying, &ldquo;What
mercies I am surrounded with! the use of my hands, what a
comfort! how different would it be if I was not able to help
myself; and with how many this is the case, who have illnesses
that take away the power of helping themselves with their own
hands; but I can use mine, and what a mercy!&rdquo;&mdash;then,
affectionately looking at me, she continued, &ldquo;and what a
comfort art thou, my choice friend! and the love of Jesus, O how
precious!&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Perks was this evening in the room
with her, but she was too heavy to converse; on Mrs. Perks going,
however, she came quite to herself, and said, &ldquo;The Lord
bless you, your partner, and children.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Perks
kindly offered to sit up, but she <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>would never hear of any one sitting
up with her till (she said) she felt the need of more help than I
could give.&nbsp; My sister, also, was desirous of being in the
room, but this she would not admit of.</p>
<p>All this day her breathing was exceedingly difficult: in the
morning she had walked into the other room, as usual, with only
the help of my arm; at the middle of the day she wished to go
into the chamber again, and I led her, as at other times; but she
was now weaker, and I could scarcely keep her from falling: I
therefore asked her to sit down in a chair, which she did, and I
wheeled her back again: with this she was much pleased, and said,
the exercise had done her good.&nbsp; At dinner she eat a small
bit of light pudding, with as much appetite as usual, but she had
taken very little for some time.&nbsp; All the afternoon she was
extremely ill, either hot to a great degree, shivering with cold,
or very drowsy.</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>But
through all, her mouth was full of the loving kindness of the
Lord.&nbsp; She said she would not go to bed till after ten
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; We always prayed together before we went
into the chamber, her breath being so greatly oppressed: she
prayed very sweetly, but short, and then said, &ldquo;Now you
call upon the Lord; I can enjoy your prayer, though not able to
speak:&rdquo; I did so, and found an uncommon degree of liberty
while pleading the gracious promises made to the people of
God.&nbsp; When I had ended, she said it had been to her soul a
peculiar time of enjoyment, while I was calling upon the Lord;
and concluded saying, &ldquo;O this has done me
good.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the afternoon, hearing that Dr. Yonge, (who
has always shewn her the greatest attention,) was ill, she twice
prayed particularly for him.</p>
<p>When we were ready to go into the chamber, and it was after
ten, I got her into the chair, but she was now weaker than at
noon; however I wheeled her to <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>the bed side, and could not but look
upon her as dying; and indeed so she considered herself, for when
got into bed, she said, &ldquo;My love, this is the last time I
shall get into bed; it has been hard work to get in, but it is
work I shall do no more: this oppression upon my breath cannot
last long, but all is well; the Lord will shower down ten
thousand blessings upon thee, my tender nurse, my kind
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After these and many more kind expressions to the same effect,
and having embraced her, and put all her things as usual, she
desired I would make haste to bed.&nbsp; I entreated her to let
me sit up, repeatedly saying, &ldquo;Do let me watch with you
this one night:&rdquo; but with all the tenderness imaginable,
yet with that degree of firmness which made me unwilling to urge
the request further, she said, &ldquo;Go to bed; you have done
all for me you can do, and you know you can be with me in a
moment if I want you; but if you sit up, it will <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>make me
uncomfortable: I cannot rest without you go to bed.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I told her I had a few things to do, before I could get into bed;
she replied, &ldquo;Then make haste and do them, for I want you
in bed: I cannot rest till I know you are in bed.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After I had made all the excuses I could for remaining up, and
looking upon her dear countenance as long as her kind concern for
me would admit, she still urged my going to bed, and I therefore
laid me within the bed-clothes, without taking my own off; and
when she again put the question, &ldquo;Are you my love in
bed?&rdquo; I answered &ldquo;Yes:&rdquo; she then said,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, now if I can rest I will; but let our
hearts be united in prayer, and the Lord bless both thee and
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were the last words her beloved lips uttered; for an
hour after this, about one o&rsquo;clock in the morning of
December 9th, the noise her breath had so long made,
ceased.&nbsp; I thought, is she dropped asleep? it immediately <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>came to my
mind, &ldquo;Asleep in Jesus: see a soul escape to
bliss.&rdquo;&nbsp; I went directly to her bed side, where I
found the beloved body without the immortal spirit, which had
entered the realms of endless day.&nbsp; My feelings are not to
be described; I clung to the casket of the saint, I knelt down by
the side of it, and cried to him who had just now called home the
spirit of my friend, that the mantle might rest on me.&nbsp; At
length I thought I should injure her dear remains, if I did not
call the family up; I therefore went and called my sister and the
servant, at half past one; after which I sent for Mrs. Perks, who
kindly came over immediately.&nbsp; I never left the chamber,
while any thing could be done for her: I had promised to be with
her to the last, and the Lord enabled me so to do.</p>
<p>Her countenance was as sweet a one as was ever seen in
death.&nbsp; There was at last neither sigh, groan, or struggle,
but all the appearance of a person in the <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>most composed
slumber.&nbsp; When I first undrew the curtain, and saw her dear
head dropped off the pillow, and looking so sweetly composed, I
could not persuade myself the spirit was fled, till I took her in
my arms, and found no motion left.&nbsp; I then perceived, the
moment she had so much longed for, had arrived; for I think I
have heard her some hundreds of times exclaim, with the most
vehement desire, &ldquo;O, my Jesus, when shall I fly to thy
arms!&rdquo;&nbsp; She was always looking and waiting for the
happy moment when she should gain the blissful shore, and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;See the Lamb in glory stand,<br />
Encircled with his radiant band,<br />
And join the angelic pow&rsquo;rs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All that height of glorious bliss<br />
Her everlasting portion is,<br />
And all that heaven is her&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the last two years of her life she was remarkably partial
to the two following hymns of Mr. Wesley&rsquo;s; but as <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>the print of
the book they were in was small and pale, I wrote them out upon a
sheet of paper, which lay in a desk by her side, to the
last.&nbsp; These she greatly delighted in, calling them, her
sweet hymns.&nbsp; As they are not in our common hymn books, I
here insert them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">FIRST HYMN.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">And</span> shall I, Lord, the
cup decline,<br />
So wisely mixt by Love divine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And tasted first by thee<br />
The bitter draught thou drankest up,<br />
And but this single, sacred drop,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hast thou reserved for me.</p>
<p>Lord, I receive it at thy hand,<br />
And bear, by thy benign command,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The salutary pain:<br />
With thee to live, I gladly die<br />
And suffer here, above the sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With my dear Lord to reign.</p>
<p>Here only can I shew my love,<br />
By suffering, my obedience prove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when thy heaven I share,<br />
I cannot mourn for Jesu&rsquo;s sake,<br />
I cannot there thy cup partake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot suffer there.</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Full
gladly, then, for thee I grieve,<br />
The honor of thy cross receive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bless the happy load;<br />
Who would not in thy footsteps tread,<br />
Who would not bow with thee his head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sympathize with God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">SECOND HYMN.</p>
<blockquote><p>JESUS! thy Sovereign Name I bless!<br />
Sorrow is joy, and pain is ease,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To those that trust in thee:<br />
All things together work for good,<br />
To me, the purchase of thy blood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The much-loved sinner, me.</p>
<p>With thee, O Christ, on earth I reign,<br />
In all the awful pomp of pain;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But send me piercing eyes,<br />
Th&rsquo; eternal things unseen to see,<br />
The crown of life prepared for me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And glittering in the skies.</p>
<p>As sure as now thy cross I bear,<br />
I shall thy heavenly kingdom share,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And take my seat above;<br />
Celestial joy is in this pain,<br />
It tells me, I with thee shall reign,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In everlasting love.</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>The
more my sufferings here increase,<br />
The greater is my future bliss;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thou my griefs dost tell;<br

They in thy book are noted down,<br />
A jewel added to my crown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is every pain I feel.</p>
<p>So be it, then, if thou ordain,<br />
Crowd all my happy life with pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And let me daily die:<br />
I bow, and bless the sacred sign,<br />
And bear the cross, by grace divine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which lifts me to the sky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having before mentioned the unwearied love and strong
attachment she so invariably manifested towards me, I will here
insert a short letter or two, which she wrote in different years,
but each in the season of bodily affliction, when, to human
appearance, death was nigh at hand.&nbsp; The first was
occasioned by my expressing a wish, if I died at Madeley, that I
might be buried in the same grave with her.&nbsp; After we had
been conversing on the subject, I was called away from her, and
on my return found on the table, a paper, on which she had
written the following words:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>My dear Friend,</p>
<p>As you have expressed a wish to be buried in our grave, if you
should continue to wish it, I here declare my <i>desire</i> that
it should <i>be so</i>.&nbsp; You are to me a faithful helper,
and as a gracious gift of providence, I esteem and value you: and
my prayer is, that after my death you may meet with the same
measure from others, that you have measured unto me.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">MARY FLETCHER.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this was written in the year 1802 or 3, but not being
dated, am not certain.&nbsp; The following, I think was in 1806
or 7, but it also has no date.</p>
<blockquote><p>My dear and faithful friend,</p>
<p>I wish to give you comfort, when I am taken from you; and to
assure you how great a favor I consider your being given to me,
in the place of my dear Sally, now in glory.&nbsp; It is often
said, God takes nothing from us, but he gives something better in
the place; and so <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>it has been, for though she was the most disinterested
and tender friend, yet, in many things you are a still further
help than she was able to be.&nbsp; Your tender care and
attention to me, encourages me to hope, you will never want
assistance, nor be left friendless; for the promise is,
&ldquo;what you do unto another, shall be done unto
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are joined together in the Lord, and shall
therefore be eternally one.&nbsp; My beloved husband and me, my
friend Ryan, my Sally, and you, shall be an eternal knot which
can never be separated.&nbsp; You know what proofs I have had
that my friends in heaven do not forget me; therefore, believe we
are waiting for you, yea, and longing to hail you on the
shore.&nbsp; I might have been far more useful than I have been;
but I cast all my sins on my atoning God.&nbsp; I pray the Spirit
may richly be poured on you; and may showers of love and grace
descend on the dear people.&nbsp; You are called to labour
<i>here</i>, and God will be with you.&nbsp; I do believe the
Lord will answer my <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>prayer, by supplying all your wants.&nbsp; I wish I
could do more for you, but I commend you to him who hath said,
&ldquo;No manner of thing that is good shall be
withheld.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grieve not, my dear, for me.&nbsp; You shall soon be with me;
and perhaps I shall be oftener with you than you think for; the
spirits of the departed are very near to us.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are
come to them,&rdquo; says the Apostle.</p>
<p>The Lord bless and keep you, and return all your kindness a
hundred fold, prays your most faithful</p>
<p style="text-align: right">everlasting friend,<br />
M. FLETCHER.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another of these kind tokens of her love was dated February
11th, 1810, at which time it was thought she would very soon be
removed from us, but the gracious Lord had compassion upon his
people, and spared her to us for above five years longer: and, O!
<a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>how was
every year fraught with the fruits of righteousness.&nbsp; Well,
she laboured, and while she did so, kept her eye upon the
Saviour, whose example</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She tracked, the world she
disdain&rsquo;d.<br />
And constantly trampled on pleasure and pain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But to return to her kind epistle, written with a view to
comfort me in the separation likely to take place:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">Feb. 11th, 1810.</p>
<p>My very dear child,</p>
<p>The gracious gift of God to me, how do I feel for you, who I
am sensible will feel a great deal in my loss; but I know the
Lord will be with you, and count your every hair.&nbsp; Let not
Satan tempt you, that you could have done any thing more for me
than you have done; for you have been the most tender creature in
the world to me, and a great comfort.&nbsp; I wish I could have
done more for you in a temporal way, but my gracious father, who
hath cared for me, will care for you, I am confident.&nbsp; To
his gracious protection, I commit you: <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>we shall be one in spirit, though
divided in the flesh.&nbsp; You may perhaps stay a little behind
me, to help the dear souls in Madeley, and I trust the Spirit of
the Lord will be poured out on all you are called to do in his
cause, and then we shall be again re-united to part no more.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your faithful friend for ever,<br />
MARY FLETCHER.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last of these loving remembrances was written two years
ago, when the wound in her breast was at the worst, and it was
supposed she could not survive more than a few days.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">January 2d, 1814.</p>
<p>My dearest and best earthly friend,</p>
<p>I have only strength to say, I ask a thousand blessings on
you, both soul and body.&nbsp; God will stand by you: He will
help you through all.&nbsp; I solemnly commit you into his hands,
and He is faithful to keep that we commit unto Him.&nbsp; We
shall soon meet above, to part no more.&nbsp; You have been to me
<a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>the
<i>best</i> of friends, and God will reward you.</p>
<p>I ever remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">One with you in the Lord,<br />
M. FLETCHER.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last week of her life she wished to have manifested her
love again in this way, but writing had long been very fatiguing
to her.&nbsp; However she asked me for the paper, but as I knew
how difficult it was to her, I said, &ldquo;What is it you wish
to write? let me write for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, (she
replied,) it won&rsquo;t do for you to write what I would say,
but I think I am too weak for writing now: I only wanted to put
it down with my own hand, before I am taken from you, how
completely satisfied I am with all that you have done, and how
thankful I am that my papers are all in your hands, and nothing
to be printed but as you approve; and that I am fully persuaded
whatever trials you may have to pass through, God will be with
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was often telling me <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>how confident
she was, that the Lord would make all my way plain before me; and
has sometimes said, &ldquo;In all the painful circumstances you
will have to pass through, your language still will be, The Lord
liveth, and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my
salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She left nothing undone, that the creature could do, to soften
the stroke of separation.&nbsp; While she herself stood, as the
pigeon on the house-top, ready</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To clap the glad wing, and tower away,<br
/>
To mingle with the blaze of day;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>her longing desire for that hour was frequently expressed by
her exclaiming; &ldquo;O! my God, when shall I come to thy dear
bosom!&rdquo;&nbsp; At another time she would say, &ldquo;My
Jesus, and my all, I pant to see thee as thou art; O come, and
take me to thy loving breast.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, to write all her
lively animating expressions, would fill volumes: I must
therefore desist from recording any more of them, and conclude
this account (which <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>I have many times wished some abler hand had been the
writer of,) by mentioning, that at the beginning of her christian
warfare, she saw, as a plan for her life, the words of the
apostle Paul to Timothy, 1st Epistle, chap. v. verse 10:
&ldquo;Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up
children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the
saints&rsquo; feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she
have diligently followed every good work.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here I
cannot but appeal to all you who have known her, whether her life
has not agreed with this description, which she took as a rule
for her conduct.&nbsp; Is she not well reported of for good
works? has she not brought up children? has she not lodged
strangers? has she not washed the saints&rsquo; feet? has she not
relieved the afflicted, and diligently followed every good
work?&nbsp; These things you know she has done; yea, has she not
been abundant therein?&nbsp; But did she value herself upon any
of all the works of righteousness she wrought?&nbsp; <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>No, by no
means.&nbsp; All her salvation she ever ascribed to him who had
loved her, and washed her in his own most precious blood:
therefore, with delight she would often repeat,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Because that I can nothing do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus, do all the work alone;<br />
And bring my soul triumphant through,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To wave its palm before the throne.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I must now conclude: but not without fervently praying, that
the zeal, diligence, love, and humility, with all that faith
<i>in</i> and active dependence <i>upon</i> the Saviour, that was
in her, may dwell richly in each of you: and trusting that I also
shall be interested in your prayers, that an abundant entrance
may be administered unto me into the kingdom of our God and
Saviour, after that I have for a little longer done and suffered
his righteous will; that so I may overtake my company
that&rsquo;s gone before, and safely arrive &ldquo;where all the
ship&rsquo;s <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>company meet, who sailed with the Saviour
beneath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waiting for that happy day,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Your affectionate friend, and
willing servant, in Christ,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">MARY TOOTH.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The following hymn of Mr. Newton&rsquo;s, being very
expressive and suitable to the occasion, was sung at Madeley,
when the above letter was read there.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">HYMN.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">In</span> vain my fancy
strives to paint<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The moment after death;<br />
The glories that surround the saints,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When yielding up their breath.</p>
<p>One single sigh their fetters breaks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We scarce can say, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
gone!&rdquo;<br />
Before the willing spirit takes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mansion near the throne.</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>Faith
strives, but all its efforts fail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To trace her in her flight:<br />
No eye can pierce within the veil<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which hides that world of light.</p>
<p>Thus much (and this is all) we know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They are completely blest;<br />
Have done with sin, and care, and woe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with their Saviour rest.</p>
<p>On harps of gold they praise his name,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His face they always view;<br />
Then let us followers be of them,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That we may praise him too.</p>
<p>Their faith and patience, love and zeal,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should make their memory dear;<br />
And, Lord, do thou the prayers fulfil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They offer&rsquo;d for us here.</p>
<p>While they have gain&rsquo;d, we losers are,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We miss them day by day;<br />
But thou canst every breach repair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wipe our tears away.</p>
<p>We pray, as in Elisha&rsquo;s case,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When great Elijah went,<br />
May double portions of thy grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To us who stay, be sent.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
